Circles
a jigsaw like puzzle game where you match the coloured half circles. Some pieces can be freely moved or rotated, others have restrictions.
A circle with a + on it can be dragged anywhere there is an empty space.
Seeing a - or | that circle is constrained to a horizontal or vertical movement.
When a circle has an inner circle on it, that circle piece can be rotated when clicked.
If you see a semicircle, the colours are flipped on an axis.


Solitaire
a relaxed game of solitaire. You can choose card backing colours. You can choose to use a free play mode if you get stuck. This allows you to move cards almost anywhere. You can choose your deck draw amount. You can also turn off auto flip for uncovered cards, so you have to flip them yourself. You can also place any card into an empty column, free play or not. If you want to use the kings only rules, just don't drop other cards in there. I also have this delayed card snake effect when you have enough of them stacked, because it looks cool.

All games will play in 2D, VR and XR modes, this works for the Quest 3/3s VR headset. I haven't tested it on any others.
